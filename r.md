INTRO

In the time of 2022, YouTube is a top and major video sharing platform among the non-subscription-based video distribution platform. Since the launch (The year 2005), no other platform made its way to the top over Youtube. In the past 16 years, Youtube has gained a major audience base of 2 billion per month. Every day there are almost 1 billion hours of videos uploaded on YouTube. But whenever we open a video, we sometimes realize that not every single video is in our native language. So that’s why YouTube implemented **Video Captions** or **Subtitles** which show a written transcript over the video as an overlay. But sometimes we need those captions for our work, education, and research purposes. So, we made a simple tool using Python to extract and download the subtitle in a text file from the particular Youtube video Link. This tool is very simple and only needs a Youtube video link that has at least one caption to operate.

All the installation instructions, examples and necessary details are mentioned below for a brief working behavior for this tool.

Other Similar Tools

There is a vast number of websites and software available to download subtitles. But whenever we use this third-party tool, we are being used for ad targeting or it may be collecting our valuable data and selling it to the companies which later used it for ad targeting.

But the python tool which we have created is completely ad-free, easy to use, and open source for anyone to use or modify for their preferences.

How to use

For this script [youtube\_transcript\_api] python library is required, to install it type- [pip install youtube\_transcript\_api] or [pip install –r requirement.txt]

**Step 1 :-**

Open the terminal and start the tool by typing 

[python YouTube-Subtitle-Downloader.py]

` `there you can find a prompt where you have to enter the Video URL.

**Step 2:-**

Now, we need a YouTube video that at least has one subtitle file attached to it, we need to copy the URL of that particular video.

for example, use this Youtube link – “youtube.com/watch?v=PP9bexwAdwA” 

**Step 3:-**

When you enter the video URL, there you can find two options, select no.1\* for the original English subtitle and select another one for translated subtitles.

- I assume that you selected option 2 for the translated subtitles, there you can find 3 languages Hindi, Bengali, and Spanish. The next step is to select the language using code like ‘**hi**’ for HINDI, ‘**bn**’ for BENGALI, and ‘**es**’ for SPANISH.

**Step 4:-**

When you select your language, you are redirected to choose the preferred file name for the subtitle file.

- If you choose option No.1\* then you are directly redirected to choose the file name.

**Step 5:-**

In the end, you can find your subtitle file on the same folder which you used to operate the tool.

Future Works

- Our tool currently supports only 4 languages, in the end, our goal is to make the tool prepared for more languages.
- Currently, we are preparing to make a Chrome Extension so that users can download subtitles in a one-click solution.
- If a user watches a video and tries to download the subtitle of that video then the user can click on the extension to directly download the particular subtitle. 
- With Chrome, extension users can interact with our tool more conveniently.


Conclusion

Here, we have come to the end of our Presentation. We tried our best to include all the necessary points that are required related to our Minor Project. Some of the information we wrote in the presentation were taken from the internet and we have also referred to some books. This presentation contains information about our Minor Project which is related to the YouTube Subtitles Downloader. We do hope that our project will be interesting and maybe even useful to the users.
