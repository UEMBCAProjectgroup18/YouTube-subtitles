For this script [youtube_transcript_api] python library is required, to install it type-
[pip install youtube_transcript_api]
Step 1:
Open the terminal and start the tool by typing [python YouTube-Subtitle-Downloader.py] there you can find a prompt where you have to enter the Video URL.

Step 2:
First of all, we need a YouTube video that at least has one subtitle file attached to it, we need to copy the URL of that particular video, for example use this Youtube link -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn2GouPAl-g&ab_channel=EnglishSpeakingCourse 

Step 3:
When you enter the video URL, there you can find two options, select no.1* for the original English subtitle and select another one for translated subtitles.

I assume that you selected option 2 for the translated subtitles, there you can find 3 languages Hindi, Bengali, and Spanish. The next step is to select the language using code like ‘hi’ for HINDI, ‘bn’ for BENGALI, and ‘es’ for SPANISH.

Step 4:
When you select your language, you are redirected to choose the preferred file name for the subtitle file.
If you choose option No.1* then you are directly redirected to choose the file name.

Step 5:
At the end, you can find your subtitle file on the same folder which you used to operate the tool. (edit this if I am wrong)
